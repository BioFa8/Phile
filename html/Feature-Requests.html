<ul>
<li><p>more documentation :) +3<br>But actually, <code>documentation</code> is very &quot;general&quot; concept. I propose to clarify it:</p>
<ul>
<li>doc about cache system (how it works(idea), how long cache lives, which kinds are available)</li>
<li>doc about available Utills/snippets, like <code>\Phile\Utills</code> and so on</li>
<li>may be, how Phile works (concept, usefull for plugin/core-developers)</li>
<li>other docs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>better navigation concept: e.g. multi level navigations, navigation templates +2</p>
</li>
<li>not a <em>feature</em>, but perhaps replace the masterfile README.MD with something less Pico-comparative. Phile can stand on its own (with attribution, of course.)<ul>
<li>maybe I don&#39;t understand you, but the README.md file is for github</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>code refactoring: rework the plugin handling and hooking system <a href="https://github.com/NeoBlack/">@NeoBlack</a></li>
<li>optimize performance: e.g. do not parse content in get_pages call <a href="https://github.com/NeoBlack/">@NeoBlack</a></li>
<li>code refactoring: build model and repository classes for objects like pages <a href="https://github.com/NeoBlack/">@NeoBlack</a></li>
<li>code refactoring: code cleanup for Pico::__construct() split of in some init methods <a href="https://github.com/NeoBlack/">@NeoBlack</a></li>
<li>code refactoring: use a registry pattern instead of &quot;passing by reference&quot; e.g. for template engine <a href="https://github.com/NeoBlack/">@NeoBlack</a></li>
<li>multiple column/block support see <a href="https://github.com/NeoBlack/Pico/tree/feature/multiColumnSupport">https://github.com/NeoBlack/Pico/tree/feature/multiColumnSupport</a> <a href="https://github.com/NeoBlack/">@NeoBlack</a> <strong>this is done by template engines</strong></li>
<li>optimize performance: use singleton classes for objects like a page <a href="https://github.com/NeoBlack/">@NeoBlack</a></li>
<li>allow Markdown configuration. e.g set in config (DONE, parse can be replaced by plugin and the config can be overwritten)</li>
</ul>

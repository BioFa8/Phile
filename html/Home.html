<p>You can download the <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax.text">markdown test file</a> from the site of John Gruber (the creator of markdown) or you can use <a href="https://gist.github.com/james2doyle/6540193">this base file</a> that was taken from the fantastic <a href="http://mouapp.com/">Mou Markdown editor</a>. Use these files to style the content pages of your theme.</p>
<p>Special thanks goes out to these folks. Without their contributions to the open source community, PhileCMS would not be what it is today.</p>
